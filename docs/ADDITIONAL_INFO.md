# Additional features

## CI/CD pipeline

This project includes a Github workflow and a Azure DevOps Pipeline for deploying the resources to Azure on every push to main. That workflow requires several Azure-related authentication secrets to be stored as Github action secrets. To set that up, run:

```shell
azd pipeline config
```

## Enable AZD support for ADE (Azure Development Environment)

You can configure `azd` to provision and deploy resources to your deployment environments using standard commands such as `azd up` or `azd provision`. When `platform.type` is set to devcenter, all `azd` remote environment state and provisioning uses dev center components. `azd` uses one of the infrastructure templates defined in your dev center catalog for resource provisioning. In this configuration, the infra folder in your local templates isnâ€™t used.

```shell
 azd config set platform.type devcenter
```

## Monitoring

The deployed resources include a Log Analytics workspace with an Application Insights based dashboard to measure metrics like server response time and failed requests. We also included some custom visuals in the dashboard to visualize the token usage per consumer of the Azure OpenAI service.

![azd-apic-sap](docs/images/dashboard.png)

To open that dashboard, run this command once you've deployed:

```shell
azd monitor --overview
```

### Clean up

To clean up all the resources you've created and purge the soft-deletes, simply run:

```shell
azd down --force --purge
```

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted and you'll not be prompted if you want the soft-deletes to be purged.

## Build Status

After forking this repo, you can use this GitHub Action to enable CI/CD for your fork. Just adjust the README in your fork to point to your own GitHub repo.

## Additional Details

The following section examines different concepts that help tie in application and infrastructure.

### Architecture in detail

This repository illustrates how to deploy a solution that integrates SAP APIs and Azure API Management APIs into Azure API Center.

We've used the Azure Developer CLI Bicep Starter template to create this repository. With `azd` you can create a new repository with a fully functional CI/CD pipeline in minutes. You can find more information about `azd` [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/).

One of the key points of `azd` templates is that we can implement best practices together with our solution when it comes to security, network isolation, monitoring, etc. Users are free to define their own best practices for their dev teams & organization, so all deployments are followed by the same standards.

When it comes to security, there are recommendations mentioned for securing your Azure API Management instance. For example, with the use of Front Door or Application Gateway (see [this](https://github.com/pascalvanderheiden/ais-sync-pattern-la-std-vnet) repository), proving Layer 7 protection and WAF capabilities, and by implementing OAuth authentication on the API Management instance. How to implement OAuth authentication on API Management (see [here](https://github.com/pascalvanderheiden/ais-apim-oauth-flow) repository).

### Azure API Center

[Azure API Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-center/overview) is a service that provides a centralized inventory of all your organization's APIs. It allows you to organize and filter APIs and related resources using built-in and custom metadata properties, to help with API governance and discovery by API consumers.

### Azure API Management

[Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/) is a fully managed service that enables customers to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs. It is a great way to expose your APIs to the outside world in a secure and manageable way.

### Application Insights

[Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) allows you to monitor your application. You can use this to monitor the performance of your application.

### Log Analytics

[Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) allows you to collect and analyze telemetry data from your application. You can use this to monitor the performance of your application.

### Azure Monitor

[Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) allows you to monitor the performance of your application. You can use this to monitor the performance of your application.

### Azure Key Vault

[Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) allows you to store and manage your application's secrets. You can use this to store your application's secrets.
